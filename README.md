# HicEtNunc-p5js-templates

Helpful p5.js templates built for minting interactive NFTs on Hic et Nunc.

### Getting started
First, make sure to read the [guide to interactive OBJKTs](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/wiki/Interactive-OBJKTs).

### Three.js, Shaders, etc.
More hicetnunc html templates (three.js, glsl, etc) can be found at https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/tree/main/templates

### Credits
The hicetnunc specific code is adapted from the original [html-p5js-template](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/tree/main/templates/html-p5js-template) by Nick Fox-Gieg

Thanks to Andre Venancio, @pichiste (Daniel Massey), and @Makio135 (Lionel Radisson) for making interactive NFTs possible, and to everyone who kept experimenting and expanding what can be done on Hic et Nunc.
